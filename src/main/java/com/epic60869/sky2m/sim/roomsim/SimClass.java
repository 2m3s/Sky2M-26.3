/**
 * The Mage's left-click beam ("Mage Staff"), and the client half of the class keys.
 *
 * <p>Since 2026-11-01 the sim has all five classes ({@link SimClassKit}); this file is what is left of the time
 * Mage was the only one. The beam fires only for a selected Mage - any other class swings its weapon for real,
 * as on Hypixel - and the Dungeon Orb's left click and the drop key are read here and handed to
 * {@link SimClassKit#clientInput}. The history below is why the beam is shaped the way it is.
 *
 * <p>killer560 (2026-09-28): "make it so the only class you can be is mage with the left. Click beam. It does
 * not need the sheep or the ultimate just the beam you can make it so all mobs have one HP and all damage does
 * some amount that will one tap every mob".
 *
 * <p>So this is deliberately not a class system. There is one class, it has one attack, and that attack always
 * kills. That is enough to practise a clear - the thing being practised is the route and the order you kill
 * things in, not the damage numbers - and every piece of it that is not needed is a piece that can be wrong.
 *
 * <p>The beam is hitscan along the look vector, stopping at the first wall. Mobs in the sim have one health, so
 * "damage that one taps" is any damage at all; this uses a large number anyway so that a mob which somehow kept
 * its real health still dies rather than silently surviving and making the sim feel broken.
